It was the day between the Queen's official birthday and St George's day.  We
had been having grown-up talks, house buying, settling down, starting a
family.  And we came to a decision - we will play for a year before doing all of
the above!

So on this Sunday afternoon, we researched (read through others' lists of "things to do
before having babies"), brainstormed (on [Trello](http://www.trello.com)), shortlisted,
and came up with our own big list.  And this blog was born - to record
our adventures on this journey and beyond.
